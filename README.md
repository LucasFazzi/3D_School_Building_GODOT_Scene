# 3D_School_Building_GODOT_Scene


This is a little modeling I had done years ago in Microsoft's 3D Builder, and I decided to export to Godot by testing a 3D scene in the game engine; The model has no Collisions yet, but Meshes work relatively well on the 3D Builder > Godot Import transition; for the first person player, i'm using the script from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbyyjmOji0M&t=4s with minor modifications made by me
